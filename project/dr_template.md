### Descriptions
More detailed descriptions of each asset identified above.

## DR Plan
### Pre-Steps:
List steps you would perform to setup the infrastructure in the other region. It doesn't have to be super detailed, but high-level should suffice.
* Create a Route53 record, configure DNS failover policy to shift the traffic
* Preconfigure the S3 (Terraform State files) and AMIs
* Configure Terraform files (duplicate configuration in zone2 with correct AZs)
* Create Key Pairs and deploy the EKS Clusters, Security Groups
* Deploy Prometheus and Grafana
* Access the DR Dashboard on Grafana the check the DR deployment 
* Deploy the ALB, EC2 and check the DR Dashboard
* Configure the read RDS cluster with replication on primary cluster
* Monitor again

## Steps:
You won't actually perform these steps, but write out what you would do to "fail-over" your application and database cluster to the other region. Think about all the pieces that were setup and how you would use those in the other region
* Stop the RDS in primary region, failover will point to the read cluster
* Verify the RDS failed over
* Redirect the IP to the new Cluster write and read replicas
* Redirect the IPs of the ALB to the new Failover region
